## **Mini Project 2: Data Curation**

### **Introduction**
Data curation involves cleaning and preparing raw data for analysis. This step ensures the data is accurate, consistent, and ready for exploration.

### **Steps**
1. **Data Sourcing**: Use the provided datasets (customers, products, marketing campaigns).
2. **Data Profiling**: Examine the data for quality issues (e.g., missing values, outliers).
3. **Data Wrangling**: Clean the data and transform it for analysis.

### **Tasks**
- Combine similar columns (e.g., marital status) into a single column.
- Calculate summary statistics (min, max, mode, range, mean, median).
- Identify and handle errors (e.g., negative values, blanks).
- Recalculate summary statistics after cleaning to observe changes.

### **Tools**
- Excel functions (e.g., IF statements, conditional formatting).
- Basic Excel charts (e.g., bar charts, histograms) for visual analysis.

## **Mini Project 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

### **Introduction**
EDA involves exploring the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between variables.

### **Steps**
1. **Select Columns of Interest**: Identify key variables for analysis (e.g., sales, customer demographics).
2. **Explore Individual Columns**:
   - Check for null values and data distributions.
   - Compute basic statistics (mean, median, mode).
   - Analyze date columns for trends and seasonality.
3. **Plot Two-Dimensional Distributions**:
   - Compare independent and dependent variables (e.g., sales vs. marketing spend).
   - Use scatter plots to identify correlations.
4. **Analyze Correlations**:
   - Validate hypotheses using correlation analysis.
   - Identify surprising relationships and investigate further.

### **Tools**
- Excel pivot tables for aggregation.
- Data visualization tools (e.g., bar charts, histograms, scatter plots).
